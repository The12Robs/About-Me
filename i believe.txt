MY BELIEFS
----------

Knowing things is very hard, and messy.
You should be willing to change your mind given sufficient evidence.
Most people don't have any idea what "sufficient evidence" should be (it's a hard question).
There is no god as popular religions conceive of it.
There is probably nothing we would reasonably consider a god.
