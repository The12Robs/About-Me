QUESTIONS I HAVE
----------------
In Statistics: If you have a 5% error bars on a graph of something measured in %, do you add +/- 5 percentage points to get the bars, or +/- 5 PERCENT?
In Statistics: If you have two samples (like in a time series) and they have different sampling errors, how do you compare them?  Do you add the error bars together?
